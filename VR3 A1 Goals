###Background:

I have 20+ years of experience working with data. My first 15+ years were spent finding data, cleaning and formatting, analyzing numbers and words, to be able to make sense of it and convert it to information.  Over the last 5 years, I have been able to add another dimension, visualization, to my "making sense of data" arsenal.

###Current Tools:

Still, 80-90% of my time is spent cleaning, formatting, and validating data. The data lives in SQL databases or MS Excel worksheets. For visualization, I use Tableau for financial and sales dashboards and TreeMapÂ©  <http://www.treemap.com/> for telecom  analyses. 

###Goals:

Make time to learn how to tell better stories with data.  Learn about new tools, add them to my tool kit, so I can be more effective data sense maker.
