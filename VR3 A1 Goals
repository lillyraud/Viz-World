###Background:

I have 20+ years of experience analyzing data. My first 15+ years were spent finding data, scrubbing, formatting, and finally analyzing - to be able to make sense of it and convert it to usable information, presenting the findings in static reports. In the last five years, I have been able to add another dimension, visualization, to my arsenal.

###Current Tools:

Still, 80-90% of my time is spent scrubbing, formatting, and validating data. The data lives in SQL databases or MS Excel worksheets. For visualization - I use Tableau for financial and sales dashboards and TreeMapÂ©  <http://www.treemap.com/> for telecom  analyses. 

###Goals:

Make time to learn how to tell better stories with data.  Learn about new tools, add them to my tool kit, so I can be more effective data sense maker.  Why visualization? Visualization enriches the experience. It lets the audience to go into the story, explore it, and allows them to come to their own conclusions.
